# CSE 255 HW5

## Main directory structure
The following directories are on github [here](https://github.com/UCSD-Data-Science/Public-CSE255-2022/tree/master/notebooks/Section4-Final-Project)

- `KDTrees+XGBoost/`: contains KD Trees and XGBoost apporach developped by Professor Freund
- `cnn/`: contains CNN and bootstraps apporach developped by TAs. 
- `public_tables/`: contains csv files that define the trianing and test sets: `country_test_reduct.csv, random_test_reduct.csv, train.csv` .
- `XGBoostCreate_submission/` the directory that contains the files to be submitted.
- `README.md` - this file

The following directories should be in your path (already on datahub)

* `poverty-dir`: A pointer to the directory that contains `/anon_dir/` under which all of the anonymized images reside. On datahub this path is: `/datasets/cs255-sp22-a00-public/poverty/`

## How to submit your code

### Fies to be upoaded to gradescope:
1.  `results.csv`
2. `country_results.csv`
3. `explanation.md`: this file must contain an english explanaton for how your code works. The explanation should be between 300 and 500 words long.

The fourth file depends on whether or not you checkpoint is smaller enough for nbgrader.

* If file is smaller than 50MB then you upload your code (organization described below) as `code.tgz`
* If file is larger than 50MB then you upload it as a `.tgz` file to `https://www.dropbox.com/request/6L9YhZ8jStt7z1fxiFwc`. The filename of the `.tgz` file should be something meaningful (it can be your submission name on Gradescope). Then, create a little text file called `code.id` and state in it the name of the file that you uploaded and the time of the upload.

Thus, you should only submit 4 files to Gradescope:

1. `results.csv`
2. `country_results.csv`
3. `explanation.md`
4. `code.tgz` OR `code.id`

You can either directly upload these 4 files to Gradescope without zipping them or you can zip them and submit the zip file. 

**If you choose to upload a zip file, make sure that all 4 files are directly inside your zip file without any folder.** That is, you should see 4 FILES (reuslts.csv, results_country.csv, explanation.md, code.tgz/code.id) instead of a FOLDER after DIRECTLY opening your zip file. This is the error you will probably get if you didn't follow the structure.

```
Test Failed: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../submission/results.csv'
```

### Code Directory Structure:

Inside your `code.tgz` (uploaded on Gradescope) or any `.tgz` file (uploaded to dropbox), you should have a folder named using any of following name.

- `XGBoostCreate_submission/` or 
- `NN_submission/` or 
- `other_submission`

**Your folder can only be these 3 names**.

Inside this directory, you should have the following subfolders: 

1. `code/`: contains:
   * `learn.py <poverty_dir>`: A script that performs the learning. it takes as input the file 
    `../public_tables/train.csv` and the images in the path `poverty_dir/anon_images/`. The learned predictor is stored in a pickled dictionary file `data/Checkpoint.pkl`. This file is later read by `predict.py`
   * `predict.py <poverty_dir>`: A script that use `data/Checkpoint.pkl` and generates the files `data/results.csv` and `data/country_results.csv` according to the input files `../public_tables/random_test_reduct.csv` and `../public_data/country_test_reduct.csv`. The generated result files should be the same as the ones you submitted to Gradescope. 
   * Other files that your model needs.
2. `data/`: contains `Checkpoint.pkl` which contains the learned XGBoost predictor that can reproduce the same result files you submitted to Gradescope.

**In the above instructions, we are assuming that you run `learn.py` and `predict.py` in `XGBoostCreate_submission/` or `NN_submission/` or `other_submission`.** You need make sure the following:
- Your `learn.py` and `predict.py` take a single argument of the path to `poverty_dir` and use it to read the image files.
- Your `learn.py` and `predict.py` read the `[Your submitted folder name]/../public_tables/random_test_reduct.csv` and `[Your submitted folder name]../public_data/country_test_reduct.csv`. We provide these files in our testing, so you shouldn't include `public_tables` folder in your submission. 

### Check before you submit
Before submitting, check that you can run `predict.py` and that it generates the same results files as the one you submitted. **If these do not match, your score on the submission will be zero**. You will know if your ccode passed the test a day after your submission.


### Example calls:
The following commands are assumed to be executed inside the directory `XGBoostCreate_submission/`, `NN_submission/` or `other_submission`. The first line is the command as it would be executed on datahub. The following blocks are the output from running the commands on a laptop.

* `python3 code/learn.py /datasets/cs255-sp22-a00-public/poverty/`
